# Pneumonia-detection-system


Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

Early Signs of Pneumonia

* Cough
* Fever
* Shortness of breath
* Rapid, shallow breathing
* Sharp or stabbing chest pain
* Loss of appetite
* Low energy
* Fatigue

Out of many possible tests present to detect the most widely used technique is Chest X-ray. 
X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves, which create pictures of the inside of your body. They are not expensive when compared to other imaging techniques and can be used by patients with metal implants in the body.
**Dataset description 

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.
