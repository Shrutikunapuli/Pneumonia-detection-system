# Pneumonia-detection-system


Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

Early Signs of Pneumonia

* Cough
* Fever
* Shortness of breath
* Rapid, shallow breathing

**Dataset description**

Out of many possible tests present to detect the most widely used technique is Chest X-ray. 
X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves, which create pictures of the inside of your body. They are not expensive when compared to other imaging techniques and can be used by patients with metal implants in the body.


Adapted version of Paul Mooney's 'Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)' dataset, where the amount of observations for training and validation purposes was redistributed to allow for a more balanced machine learning exercise.
Total number of observations (images): 5,856
Training observations: 4,192 (1,082 normal cases, 3,110 lung opacity cases)
Validation observations: 1,040 (267 normal cases, 773 lung opacity cases)
Testing observations: 624 (234 normal cases, 390 lung opacity cases)
